# Programming-Assignment-1

This contains all the programming codes for this assignment. Doing the ARM assembly assignments, I gained understanding of low-level programming concepts, particularly how data is manipulated directly to registers and memory. I learned how to use bitwise operations, logical shifts, and conditional execution like CMP, MOVGT, BNE, etc., to solve the given problems.

Implementing the tasks such as bitwise parity checking, nibble swapping, and finding the largest integer in an array helped reinforce how looping and branching work at the instruction level. One of the challenges I've faced is for doing the Euclidean Algorithm because the UDIV command was not working properly.
